#### _Innovation over imitation — one encrypted byte at a time._

### **About Me**

I write code, break it immediately, fix it eventually, then pretend it was intentional.<br>
I believe in clean systems, encrypted conversations, and Messi’s left foot (the real GOAT algorithm).<br>
Kendrick’s lyrics debug my brain better than any stack trace.

**Currently cooking:** **Enzypher** — an encrypted chat system that doesn’t trust anyone. Not even me.

### **Fun Facts**

- I don’t follow tutorials; I negotiate with them.
- My code works better at 2 AM for no scientific reason.
- Sometimes I write code so clean even I get suspicious.
- Every bug I fix unlocks **+5 wisdom** and **+3 paranoia**.

### **Final Thought**

```
In a world of copy-paste coders, be a cipher.
```
