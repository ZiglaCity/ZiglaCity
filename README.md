- 👋 Hi, I’m Zigla — but you can call me Zigla City!
- 👀 I'm deep into tech, with a focus on Python development, cybersecurity, programming, and AI. I’m also a big fan of football and hip-hop (Kendrick & Eminem on repeat).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, React, and continuing to level up my Python skills while exploring the world of AI.
- 💞️  I’m up for anything that blends Python and creativity, especially AI projects or interactive apps.
- 📫 Reach Me: Drop a message on here, or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziglacity) or [Email](ziglacity@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a huge Lionel Messi fan, and I believe there's no one quite like him in our generation.
